## Scenario:
A sea full of jellyfishes, one king fish and one diver.

## Objective:
Capture the king fish. The diver has to reach the king fish while avoiding the jellyfishes.

## Specifications:
The assignment consists on finding the best policy (Q-learning e-greedy) to reach the king fish
without touching the jellyfishes. Touching a jellyfish means a discount in the reward while reaching the
king fish means a positive reward (usually).
The possible actions of the diver are: up, down, left, right.
